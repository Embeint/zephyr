  buck-reset-force-1v8:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Before performing a soft-reset, force the GPIO3 and GPIO4 pins low so that
      immediately after the soft-reset, the BUCK output is set to 1.8V.

  buck-gpio-controlled-voltage:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Keep the IC default behaviour of setting the BUCK regulator voltage from
      the state of GPIO3 and GPIO4, instead of setting these pins to inputs
      and explicitly setting the voltage.
