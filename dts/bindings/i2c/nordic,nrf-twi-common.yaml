      Maximum number of bits available in the EasyDMA MAXCNT register. This
      property must be set at SoC level DTS files.

  zephyr,no-boot-recover:

      Don't attempt to recover the bus on boot. This can be required if connected
      sensors are not powered but the I2C bus is directly connected. One example
      of this design is the Thingy53.
