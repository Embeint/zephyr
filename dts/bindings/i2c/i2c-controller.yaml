      Recover the I2C bus on boot. This can be useful to ensure the I2C bus is
      in a known good state, in case the device rebooted in the middle of an I2C
      transaction. This MUST NOT be enabled if the I2C bus lines do not idle
      high on boot (e.g. if the bus is pulled up by a switched regulator).
